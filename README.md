# Simple image search project 

![](https://github.com/kutlukarakoc/Image-Search-with-React/blob/main/searchImagesProject.png)

### In this project, I used React, Semantic UI (a little bit), HTML, CSS, unsplash.com (for api)

#### It's a simple project that we can search images and in this project.
#### When you hover on images, transform scale(1.3) is gonna trigger to make them bigger.
#### When you double click on images, image's width is gonna be 100% so they get more bigger:). 
#### After double click, if you click again width attribute is gonna be useless.
#### If you forgot to click again to resize image, you can just move on because mouseOut event is gonna make width useless again.
